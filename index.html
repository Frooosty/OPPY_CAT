            FAQ<br/>
            Q: What is OP_CAT? <br/>
            The short answer: The future of bitcoin
            <br />
            The long answer:
            OP_CAT is a new opcode that has sparked considerable debate within the cryptocurrency community 1. Unlike some other proposals for extending Bitcoin Script, OP_CAT is extremely simple to implement, simple to understand, and immediately makes Script much easier to use 1. It is a covenant system that can impose certain restrictions on the spending transaction, such as requiring that the spending transaction have an output that is exactly 1.0 BTC, or might have an output that pays out only to a very specific address 1.

The proposal to reintroduce OP_CAT has been met with enthusiasm by some and skepticism by others 2. The reintroduction of OP_CAT could be a gateway to magic or a double-edged sword
